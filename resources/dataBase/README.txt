| PRODUCT SCOPE                               |
-----------------------------------------------
> THE PRODUCT IS IDENTIFIED AS CEREAL DISPENSER
SYSTEM, CDS FOR SHORT. CDS WILL PERFORM A ROLE
OF MAKING A BOWL OF CEREAL AFTER GIVEN PROPER
TOUCH INPUT. THE SOFTWRE LOADED IN CDS'S MEMORY
WILL PROCESS ALL INFORMATION READ FROM A SET OF
 VARIOUS INPUTS WHICH WILL DESCRIBE THE TYPE OF
CEREAL AND MILK ALONG WITH IT'S QUANTITY.
REGARDING THE CEREAL INTO THE USER'S BOWL. IN
ADDITION, THERE WILL BE AIR PUMPS DISPENSING
MILK INTO THE USER'S BOWL.

> THE SYSTEM INCLUDES A RASBERRY PI 3 WHICH
WILL ACT AS A CONTROLLER FOR MOST OF THE HARDWARE
COMPONENTS INCLUDING THE SERVO MOTORS AND DC AIR
 PUMP MOTORS.

-----------------------------------------------
| PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE                         |
-----------------------------------------------
> THE CDS UTILIZES THE RAXBERRY PI 3 AS A
CONTROLLER FOR INTERNAL MECHANICS OF OUR SYSTEM.
THE PI CONTROLS THE AIR PUMPS AND MOTORS FOR
CEREAL AND MILK DISPENSING. THE CDS ALSO
INCLUDES A TOUCH SCREEN FOR USER'S INPUT. THE
USER IS ABLE TO DISPENSE CEREAL THROUGH A PUSH
OF A BUTTON. THE CDS COMPARES TO MODERN SODA
DISPENSING MACHINES. MODERN MACHINES ARE COMPACT
WHILE STILL HAVING A WIDE VARIETY OF SODA OPTIONS.
